With traditional CMSs like Wordpress, typically this feature comes with the drawback of <strong>too much power</strong>. With a blank WYSIWYG page, editors can do whatever they want, so the brand identity may suffer. As soon as you try to impose rules (for example using ACF custom post types in Wordpress) you suddenly loose the WYSIWYG ability and you are back to gray forms.</p></div></section><section class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 py-5 font-content"><div class="max-w-2xl mx-auto"><h3 class="font-content text-2xl font-black text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 mb-3 pt-8">The front-end developer’s tool: Headless CMSs</h3><p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200">A headless CMS takes care of the “back-end” side of a CMS, providing the database, the APIs and often the web interface to edit content.

The content creation interface provided by the headless CMS, in fact, knows nothing about how the content will be formatted by the frontend. The result is a <strong>worse user experience </strong>for the editors. There are other problems, too, like having links from a resource to another inside a text, since on the frontend, the internal <strong>links</strong> should be replaced with framework specific tags to use a push-history based client-side router.</p></div></section><section class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 py-5 font-content"><div class="max-w-2xl mx-auto"><h3 class="font-content text-2xl font-black text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 mb-3 pt-8">The Designer’s tool: Design system</h3><p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200">A design system (designers please forgive my simplified definition) is a set of visual components, rules and resources that helps keeping a coherent brand identity and user experience.</p><p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200">So, to deploy a design system in a CMS we need to:</p><ul class="list-disc list-outside ml-5 mt-4 text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200"><li>Define a set of <strong>visual components</strong> shared with the Developers</li><li>Enforce the <strong>correct use</strong> of this components (blocks) by Editors</li></ul></div></section><section class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 py-5 font-content"><div class="max-w-2xl mx-auto"><h3 class="font-content text-2xl font-black text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 mb-3 pt-8">JSX as a common language?</h3><p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200">I think that the best choice today for a common language shared between Developers and Designers to define visual components is JSX. It is very <strong>similar to HTML but much more expressive</strong>. I may have a bias toward JSX because I love React, but you can use JSX with Vue, too. Maybe in the future the best choice will be the standardized Web components, but today I’d bet on JSX. <strong>JSX props</strong> are also a great way to limit the Editors interface and set rules on what can or cannot be done with a component.</p></div></section><section class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 py-5 font-content"><div class="max-w-2xl mx-auto"><h3 class="font-content text-2xl font-black text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 mb-3 pt-8">Hybrid CMS: a false solution</h3><p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200">We saw that with a headless CMS we loose one of the big win of a traditional CMS, which is the ability to edit content with a WYSIWYG editor. Hybrid CMSs try to solve this problem by proposing a sort of traditional CMS which exposes APIs too, as Wordpress with REST APIs does. In this way <strong>the provided frontend is optional</strong>. The reality is that, based on how you use it, you either have the WYSIWYG editing or the APIs, but not both at once. In practice I think that the existing <strong>hybrid CMSs wink more at the editors</strong>, as they usually are on the <strong>“no code”</strong> side, providing just an API sugar pill for developers, which won’t be used on the websites without loosing the benefits of the hybrid approach.</p></div></section><section class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 py-5 font-content"><div class="max-w-2xl mx-auto"><img src="https://images.reactbricks.com/original/db6c87e2-60e3-4a5f-b7a6-aa15137fb84f.png" srcSet="https://images.reactbricks.com/src_set/db6c87e2-60e3-4a5f-b7a6-aa15137fb84f-1600.png 1600w,
